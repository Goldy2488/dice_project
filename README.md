# dice_project

• The Dice Project is a two-player game where each player has an equal number of dice. The objective of the game is to roll the 
   dice and the player with more dice showing a particular number wins the game. 
• If the number of dice showing that particular number is the same for both players, the game is tied.
• The project I learn Event handling.
